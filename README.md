# collegestudent_trend
The purpose of this project is to analyze what colleges students of a certain high school GPA, and/or a certain ACT/SAT score tend to go to, and what majors students with a certain GPA tend to choose.
To use this website, a user must click on a section of the website to see certain content related to colleges and majors.
The challenges that I faced is that this is my first time using Python to code a website, and I struggled to get CSS and images to work on my website, along with changing the font family.
The future goal is to predict a certain student of what college that they might go to, and the major that they are intending, based on their high school GPA, and/or test scores.
I am a freshman at Kansas State University majoring in Finance and Marketing looking to gain some coding experience. This is the first time creating a program (website) as part of a hackathon of the ACM club.
