      <p>Welcome to the Analysis Page!</p>
      <p>Here you can show what factors are being used to determine a student's future college, and their potential major. Interests, work experience, extracurricular experience, volunteer experience, and family's dream also comes into play. <img src="../images/analysis1.jpg" width="720" height="450" alt=""/></p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>As you can see, the higher a student's GPA and/or their test score is, the more likely that student will go to a better college (i.e. Kansas State or University of Kansas instead of colleges with lower grades like Fort Hays, Wichita State, etc.) Colleges in Kansas are not very selective, compared to out-of-state colleges. The most prestigious univerisities like Ivy League univerisites tend to be the most selective colleges in the United States. Students with higher GPAs and test scores are also more likely to pursue harder majors like Engineering, Pre-Med, and STEM majors. </p> <p>Students with lower GPAs and test scores are more likely to major in Liberal Arts, Education, Communications, and other majors that tend to be "easy". They are also more likely to attend a 2-yr community collges first and then transfer to a 4-yr university, although that is not always the case. When going to a 4-yr university straight out of high school, they are more likely to attend lower-quality colleges like Bethany College, Fort Hays State University, Wichita State University, lesser-known small 4-yr colleges, and even for-profit colleges.</p> <p> Some parents will want their children to major in certain fields because they think that it is best fit for them, due to income opportunities, and desire. A student's interests can also impact major choices (i.e. A student with an interest in art or have a hobby in art are more likely to major in art than a student who doesn't do any of that.) A student's involvement in certain school activities (i.e. A student on the yearbook club are more likely to major in mass communications than a student without such involvement with the yearbook). Work/volunteer experience can also affect a student's major choices, just not to the extent of their interests outside of work/school.</p>
